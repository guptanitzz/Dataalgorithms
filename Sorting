#Bubble Sort 

# Bubble Sort is an algorithm which is used to sort N elements that are given in a memory
# for eg: an Array with N number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by 
# one and sort them based on their values

def BubbleSort(ls):
  for i in range(0,len(ls)):
      #print(i)
      flag=0
      for j in range(0,len(ls)-i-1):
          #print(j)
          t=0
          #print(ls)
          if ls[j+1]<ls[j]:
              t=ls[j]
              ls[j]=ls[j+1]
              ls[j+1]=t
              flag=1
