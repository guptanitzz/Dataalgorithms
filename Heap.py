    While building heap , heap structure property need to be maintain ( minHeap or maxHeap)
     1. It is a complete binary tree
    2. All nodes in the tree follow the property that they are greater than their children i.e.
    the largest element is at the root and both its children and smaller than the root and so on.
    Such a heap is called a max-heap. If instead all nodes are smaller than their children, it is called a min-heap

    buildheap : O(n); you can build the heap in O(n) is to remember that the
    logn factor is derived from the height of the tree.
    For most of the work in buildHeap, the tree is shorter than logn.
